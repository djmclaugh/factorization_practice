The Symbola font, which is in the public domain, has been added to support the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols Unicode block.
In particular, this font is used to support variable characters such as ùë• (MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL X, U+1D465).

I found the Symbola font here https://www.fontspace.com/symbola-font-f22021.
